# Breast Cancer Classification using Naive Bayes

## Overview

This research project aims to implement a binary classification experiment using a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier on the "Breast Cancer Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about breast cancer patients, and the classification problem is to determine if a patient has a malignant or benign tumor. The project methodology involves data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using accuracy.

The project demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of the NB classifier in binary classification tasks and highlights its potential for solving real-world problems in healthcare. The implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm in breast cancer classification can automate the process of diagnosis and is involved in manual diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Breast Cancer Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. It includes relevant information about breast cancer patients, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured methodology:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Prepare the dataset for training, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Implement the Naive Bayes classifier for binary classification.
